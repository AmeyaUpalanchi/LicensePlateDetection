## About Project

The automatic License Plate Recognition system is a real-time embedded system that automatically recognizes the license plate of vehicles. There are many applications ranging from complex security 
systems to common areas and from parking admission to urban traffic control. Automatic license 
plate recognition (ALPR) has complex attributes because of different impacts like light and speed. 
ALPR frameworks utilizing Python and the Open CV-Library. The framework is produced for both the pictures and recordings. Both techniques have 
one common element used i.e. connected component analysis. The system comprises extracting the 
frames of digital images, Preprocessing, Localization, CCA, binary thresholding and character 
segmentation and prediction from the pictures of the panel, and the visual character Recognition.
